- include should merge directories in the copy
- thumbnail image specification
- better errors
- why are project posts with the images in one folder
- Allow inclusion only some style files using front matter
- Make the frontmatter a well defined type
- Make context errors more helpful at runtime like links to files etc.
- There could be a usecase where we look at what templates are available inside of `templates/pages/` and then 
  we render them as full pages. So index stops being a specialcase. Or something like `_index.html` and `_about.html`
- Equally I could just support a set of templates that area treated as exceptional names that people have to respect or can use.
  Given this is a very opinionated implementation it should be fine.
