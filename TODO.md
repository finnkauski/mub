1. Make context errors more helpful at runtime like links to files etc.
2. Use proper logging
3. There could be a usecase where we look at what templates are available inside of `templates/pages/` and then 
   we render them as full pages. So index stops being a specialcase. Or something like `_index.html` and `_about.html`
